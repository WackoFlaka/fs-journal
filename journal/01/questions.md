# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > Git is very useful when it comes to having your own or 
    collaborative projects. It helps store code and keeps developers to handle history changes.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > 'mkdir' is a command used in command prompt to create a folder

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | A pseudo class is used  to style selectors and the most
    common ones Ill be using are ::after, before, or hover.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Is built into css to determine which rule should be applied
    in the chance that multiple rules are targeting both the 
    same element and property on that element, but assigning different values. It goods when I'm targeting a specific element that have different values so it doesn't mess any code that Im working on. Its great to spefificity when it comes to which selectors are important.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > Mostly the problems with `!important` is it can override most selectors or ignore. 

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | The three components that make up a `CSS` are Selectors, Property and Values.

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | More importantly good design matters most on readability and catching the audience. It influences people when going into a poorly designed website will cause a lot of distrust or not interested into exploring the website. 

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | Wireframes keep the concept user-focused, wireframes clarify and define website features, and wireframes are quick and cheap to create

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | Wireframes are a great start when creating a website. Especially starting it off with a mockup, layout or a page structure. It helps developers or designers with information and interface out with code. I feel like in my opinion it should be required no matter what, because since there are types of wireframes, its great for developers to do a fresh start where everything should be placed on a website before coding. 

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | Items are arranegd alonged the main axis, from left to right

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | Margin, Padding, or Border
